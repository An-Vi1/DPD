Dissipative particle dynamics refers to a particlebased numerical method 
in which the dynamicsof particles that interact through conservative, 
dissipative, and random forces are computed. The method is coarse-grained 
molecular dynamicsand has the ability to capture flow at mesoscopic scales,
i.e., those scales that lie between microscopic and macroscopic ones.
